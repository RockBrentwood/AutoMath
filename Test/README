This is a suite of additional tests, largely inherited from version 4.2. To run tests on revisions of AutoMath from the command line, run
	./Test.sh >& Test.err
and compare Test.err with Test.out using
	diff Test.err Test.out.

As is the case for the tests in the main directory, both of these procedures will later be included in the Makefile under "make test";
and both sets of tests may be later integrated into a single test quite.
